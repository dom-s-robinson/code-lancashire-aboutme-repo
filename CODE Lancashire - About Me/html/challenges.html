            <h2 class="challengesub">Streamlining Communications</h2>
            <p>When starting in my current role, the way the team currently communicated with prospective delegates
                felt quite dated. <br>
                This included many touchpoint by multiple co-workers, which hindered the relationship building between
                the university & the client. <br>
                Being new to the role, I wanted to contribute some meaningful change to our internal processes and
                coming from a commercial sales background could see the issues that were being faced. <br>
                Working with the team, I embarked on a process mapping journey to understand the journey of our clients
                in full before making recomendations on how to streamline this process and enhance the relationship
                between university & delegate. <br>
                I brought all correspondance into one central role, my role as business liaison officer, so that
                businesses were only contacted by the one email address or phone number during their journey from
                enquiry through enrollment, programme delivery and post-programme assessment. <br>
                While this seems like a minor change, what it has done is deepen my relationship with our clients
                leading to longer-standing partnerships between business and accademia.</p>

            <h2 class="challengesub">Gaining recognition from co-workers</h2>
            <p>In my previous role working for Vodafone, I found myself quickly promoted - within one year, from a
                part-time sales advisor, to full time, to a junior management role and finally to Assistant Manager.
                <br>
                This rapid promotion caused some friction with team members who had been with the company longer and
                also caused some resistance when trying to lead the team through sales or technical training. <br>
                I solved this challenge by leading by example and showing commitment to my colleagues and role. Ensuring
                I was always ahead on the latest developments and changes within the company and ensuring that I always
                had the technical 'know-how' to back up my position. <br>
                I quickly found that by setting a good example I gained the respect and recognition needed to be a
                leader.

            <h2 class="challengesub">Getting by when you don't speak the language</h2>
            <p>Probably the most challenging time in my life was when I started teaching in Thailand. The school I was
                assigned by my training provider wasn't in what you would call a 'tourist' destination. <br>
                I believe the training provider felt comfortable assigning me to a more off the beaten track school due
                to my extensive previous travel exeprience. <br>
                This is something I had to draw upon a lot, I met 4 other people who were fluent in speaking English
                in the local area. This meant learning get-by Thai on the fly, learning how to communicate
                effectively through body-language and also finding and tapping into networks of English speaking
                communities in the wider region.</p>
